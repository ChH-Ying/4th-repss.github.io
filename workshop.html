                        <p>Towards Practical Remote Photoplethysmography Detector</p>
                        
                        <h3>Abstract:</h3>
                        <p>Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a promising enabling technology for many non-contact and non-invasive computer vision and healthcare applications, such as face presentation attack detection, heart rate and respiration rate estimation, and sleep disorder detection. While rPPG research has been performed for almost 20 years, there has been great success in the past few years. To develop such applications, one of the key factors is to develop a robust and accurate rPPG detector that is insensitive to illumination and human motion. In this talk, I will first review the development of rPPG detection and its applications. Then, I will share two recent research works on rPPG detection from my group. Finally, some future directions will be discussed.</p>

	<h2>Call for papers</h2>
        <p>The workshop calls for high-quality and original research works.  The topic includes but is not limited to:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>New methodologies and data developed for remote measurement of all kinds of physiological responses of human bodies, e.g., heart rate, heart rate variability, respiration, blood oxygen saturation, blood pressure, and others.</li>
		<li>Hardwires/apparatuses/imaging systems developed for the purpose of remote physiological measurement from the face and body.</li>
		<li>Solutions for special challenges involved with remote physiological signal sensing, e.g., low-quality video, poor illumination conditions, motions, data with noisy labels or no labels, etc.</li>
		<li>Applications of remote physiological sensing, e.g., for medical assessment in hospitals, for health surveillance at home or in other environments, for emotion assessment in various scenarios like for education, job interview, etc., for security and forensics like liveness detection, biometrics, and video editing/synthesis.</li>
		<li>Methodologies and data for the applications of all kinds of physiological signals (e.g., ECG, PPG, EEG, EDA).</li>
		<li>Self-supervised or unsupervised methods for model training on all kinds of physiological signals.</li>
	</ol>
